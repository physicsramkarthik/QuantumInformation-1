# QuantumInformation package
This book contains more than 100 numerical routines in python and it will be extremely useful for a practising physicist, both theoretical and experimentl, working in the areas of quantum information theory, quantum computing, quantum entanglement and also on condensed matter quantum many-body spin half chains. We also remark here that, there is a chapter devoted to numerical linear algebra procedures and a final chapter on random states and matrices too. We can safely and humbly say that, the computational libraries cover a wide spectrum of topics.
